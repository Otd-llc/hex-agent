# Evaluation

Every run is listed, not just the good ones. "Mock" means a scripted
stand-in, not a model.

## Runs so far

| Date | Kind | What | Result | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-10-27 | read-only probe | live page: members, catalog, sockets, validate, bom | 14 members, v1, 614 parts, 155 props | `runs/probe-*.json` |
| 2026-10-27 | contract acceptance | atomic rollback, drawer key, spike type/facing, round trip | all as documented | `runs/accept-*.json` |
| 2026-10-27 | contract acceptance | drawer on half base, then spikes at its corners | offers drop to 0; both applies refused `SPIKE_CLASH` | console log, reproducible with `scripts/explore.mjs` |
| 2026-10-27 | mock e2e | scripted 3-op build through the full loop + verify | 6/6 checks pass; round trip 4 = 4 nodes, BOM equal | `runs/mock-e2e-*.json` |
| — | live | — | not run: no API key yet | — |

## Planned suite (P1)

8 to 12 briefs, each run live with the same budgets, reporting: requirements
met per the model, refusals by code, repairs, rule and mesh verdicts, BOM and
round trip, latency, tokens and cost. Includes a drawer-beside-spike brief and
a stud-spike-facing-down brief, run as ordinary briefs, not staged failures.

## Provider labels

Every trace names its provider and the model that served each turn
(`servedBy`). Claude runs are development or an explicitly labeled baseline;
only `provider: "meta"` runs count as results for this entry.
